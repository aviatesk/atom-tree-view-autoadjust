## Atom tree-view-autoadjust package

![demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40514306/63660175-37937580-c7f0-11e9-97ae-d9d684eaac0e.gif)

This package is a fork of @lexcast 's [tree-view-autoresize](https://github.com/lexcast/tree-view-autoresize), and contains several updates/improvements:
- only resize the dock where tree-view actually exists: do not affect the dock on the opposite side
- drop the dependency of [atom-utils](https://www.npmjs.com/package/atom-utils)
- move config to package.json
- better dispositions
- will be maintained as far as I use Atom
